# 🕷️ Web Crawler

## 📖 Description
This project implements a web crawler using **Selenium** to scrape data from websites efficiently and reliably. It is designed with flexibility and robustness in mind, enabling custom crawling workflows and metadata extraction for structured data collection.

## ✨ Features

- **🔁 Resume from Last Crawl**
  - Automatically resumes the crawl process from where it was interrupted, ensuring robustness against unexpected shutdowns or network issues.

- **⚙️ Customizable Scraping Logic**
  - The crawling logic can be easily modified to suit different websites or specific scraping requirements.

- **💾 Structured Data Storage**
  - Outputs scraped data in formats such as JSON, CSV, or databases for easy analysis and integration with other tools.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)
- BeautifulSoup *(optional)*
